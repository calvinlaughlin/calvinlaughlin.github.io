    <h1 style="text-align: center;"> <br> <br> What is this website?</h1>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to my website. If you have made it to this page, that means you figured out the controls 
    and were curious enough to wander over to the ticket machine. Congratulations! Now you're probably wondering what the point of this website is.
    Well, my name is Calvin Laughlin, and I am a junior at Stanford University. I created this website to learn web development over the summer of 2022.
    I chose the Caltrain design for a couple reasons: <br>
    One, I love the Caltrain. I don't think I've ever paid the fare but it's gotten me to San Francisco and back many times. <br>
    Two, in the spring of 2022 I took a class called CS111: Operating Systems taught by John Osterhout. In the class, we implemented a synchronization problem. In the problem, each thread
    was represented by a passenger, and each train could only carry a limited number of threads. So, using a FIFO system we used locks and condition variables in C++ to manage the threads
    and ensure that nobody got on the train before it was their turn to do so. It beautifully illustrated synchronization and inspired me to make this website as a visualization to that problem.
    <br> Other than that, this website will be used to showcase things I find interesting, whether it be movies or places around LA that I like. The whole point of the website is to learn! So please, enjoy,
    and if anything breaks horribly or you want to pick a fight with me, email me at <br>
