            <h1>about</h1>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Welcome to my website. If you have made it to this page, that means you figured out the controls 
                and were curious enough to wander over to the ticket machine. Congratulations! Now you're probably wondering what the point of this website is. <br>
                Well, my name is Calvin Laughlin, and I am a junior at Stanford University. I created this website from scratch, and it was originally going to be just about me,
                but I chose to model it after the Caltrain for a few reasons: <br>
            </p>
            <p> <strong>One,</strong> I love the Caltrain. I don't think I've ever paid the fare but it's gotten me to San Francisco and back many times. <br>
                <strong>Two,</strong> in the spring of 2022 I took a class called <strong>CS111: Operating Systems</strong> taught by John Osterhout. In the class, we implemented a synchronization problem. In the problem, each thread
                was represented by a passenger, and each train could only carry a limited number of threads. So, using a FIFO system we used locks and condition variables in C++ to manage the threads
                and ensure that nobody got on the train before it was their turn to do so. It beautifully illustrated synchronization and inspired me to make this website as a visualization to that problem.

            <h3>heap allocator</h3>
            <p>Over the summer, as part of Stanford’s CS107 “Computer Systems” class, 
                I implemented both an implicit and explicit heap allocator. The implicit allocator 
                used a first fit method that favored speed over efficiency, while the explicit allocator 
                was organized using address order to traverse the explicit linked list. This project gave 
                me a very solid understanding of how computer systems work as well as programming experience.
            </p>
            <h3>sator square</h3>
            <p>As a final project for Stanford’s CS106B “Programming Abstractions” class, I created from scratch
                 a program that, via recursive backtracking, finds combinations of words in the English dictionary
                  that when put in a grid, can be read forwards, backwards, up, and down. This phenomenon of a “perfect square”
                   with words is called a Sator Square. If you’d like to read more, you can read my writeup of the project here.
            </p>
            <h3>naive bayes / linear regression</h3>
            <p>As part of Stanford's CS109 "Probability for Computer Scientists", the final project entailed creating, from scratch, classification models 
                under both the naive bayes assumption, and the more rigorous linear regression model. This project was my first foray into
                machine learning, but it has inspired further interest in the form of a python classification model that I am working on to project
                what specials will be present at each Stanford dining hall.
